# product_manager

A "Let Go" type app. Users can create an account in order to view, create, edit, favorite, and share different products.

My first full stack iOS and Android app built using Dart with the Flutter SDK, Material for design, and Firebase as the backend.

This app will be depolyed to both Android's Play Store and Apple's App Store once it is finished. 

# This app includes, but is not limited to, the following features

1. Page navigation with tabs, side drawers and stack-based navigation.
2. State management solutions including Scoped-Models.
7. Handling and validating user input.
8. Connecting to Firebase servers by sending Http requests.
9. User authentication.
10. Google Maps & Geolocation.
11. Native device features like the camera. Added natively for both iOS and Android.
12. Beautiful animations & page transitions :).
